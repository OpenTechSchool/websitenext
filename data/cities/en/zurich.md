We are a friendly group of tech enthausiast that meet regularly to work on projects, discuss technologies and help each other.

We organize events to learn, collaborate and meet other learners. If you interested in tech, would like to try out programming or if you need help with your project, feel free to join the community.

## Our Co-Learning

We meet every Tuesday from 19:00 to 21:00 at the [Liip Arena](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/721046233) to learn, educate and motivate each other. We are getting started with coding, train our skills or work on pet projects.

During the winter months, we also meet on Sunday evenings from 17:30 to 19:30.

The event is free and everyone is welcome to participate. We don't offer regular coding workshops, but we meet to talk about coding issues or any kind of question you might have when getting started with programming. People that join our meetup have different experience levels and are always happy to help.

Please read our [Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct/) before you join.

A big thanks to [Liip](https://liip.ch) for sponsoring the event space.
