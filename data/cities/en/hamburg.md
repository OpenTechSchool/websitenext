## About

The second chapter in Germany was started by Diana and Marie,
starting with a [full-week workshop] for teenage girls in the summer of 2013
after attending the first all-female hackathon of Germany in
Berlin early that year. Team Hamburg is set out to expand the fun of
coding and tech-workshops in this beautiful city with the special
nordisch-german touch.
