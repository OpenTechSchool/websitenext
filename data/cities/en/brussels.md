## About

Brussels is known for its multiculturality, governmental complexity and as the center of European politics.
But, there is more! Through OpenTechSchool we offer free workshops about new technologies for everyone.
The sprout of OTS Brussels lays in a bitcoin-meeting and rooted further in the hackerspace HSBXL.
Our main aim is to reach out, to empower individuals from any background.
We want to give people the skills to realise their own projects, would they be entrepreneur, artist,
in reinsertion, makers or just curious!
